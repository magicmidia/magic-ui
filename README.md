## Status

This project is very young (born in 09/2017), many things need to be done first ... so yes, this its not a production ready library "YET". So stay tunned with us, if you can, help us a little bit, so we can reach the ALPHA stage more quickly! Help will always be welcome. I will try to make some Social participation in a tool like Twitter or Facebook. And for sure, i will make a Slack Group for unite all people that can help and/or use this project. Lets make it together!

## Bugs and feature requests

Right now we are a very small group, and we really want to discuss new features and possibilities to make this Framework better, so feel free to use GitHub Issues for suggesting enhancements, new features and reporting bugs.

Once your sugestion of enhancement/new feature was approved, you can open a Pull Request.

For small changes or misspellings, don't hesitate to open a pull request directly.
